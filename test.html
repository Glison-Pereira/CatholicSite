        <h2>About:</h2>
        <p>
            Meet Roy Schoeman, a former Professor at Harvard Business School, as he speaks about his acceptance of atheism when he went to university and how it dragged him into a pit of hopelessness. He shares how God personally intervened in his life in a miraculous way. Now working as a catholic speaker and inspiring thousands of believers and nonbelievers with his story, he has found the true meaning of life and the overflowing ocean of God's Love.

        <h2>About:</h2>
        <p>
            Jeremy Rivera is back! He’s back to take us deeper into what it was like to be a Protestant pastor rediscovering the Catholic faith. He takes us on a journey from Hawaii to California to Colorado, and finally back into the arms of the Church. If you want to better understand how Catholics can connect with their Evangelical brothers and sisters, you don’t want to miss this.
